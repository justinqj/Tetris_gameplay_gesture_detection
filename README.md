# Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and tools spanning across four main directories. Each directory serves a unique purpose, ranging from simple Python exercises to more complex applications like a Tetris game and video frame extraction.

## 1. Python Basics

This folder is an introduction to basic Python programming. It covers foundational concepts such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists and Dictionaries

It's an excellent starting point for beginners looking to grasp the fundamentals of Python.

## 2. Python Advanced

Diving deeper into Python, this directory explores more advanced topics, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- File Handling
- Modules and Packages
- Exception Handling

These scripts provide a solid foundation for intermediate Python developers aiming to enhance their skills.

## 3. Tetris Pygame

A fun and interactive Tetris game built using the Pygame library. Features include:

- Classic Tetris gameplay with modern graphics.
- Customizable buttons with hover effects.
- Integration of webcam feed directly into the game interface.
- Dynamic text rendering with changing colors.
- A main menu with Play and Quit options.

The game showcases the power of Pygame and how it can be used to create engaging applications.

## 4. Video Extractor

This tool is designed for extracting frames from video files. Key functionalities are:

- Processing specific video formats like `.mp4` and `.avi`.
- Saving each frame of the video as individual image files.
- Customizable input and output directories.

Utilizing the OpenCV library, this script is perfect for projects that require frame-by-frame analysis of videos.

## Dependencies

To run the scripts, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pygame`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `os`

You can install them using `pip`:

```
pip install pygame opencv-python
```

## Usage

Navigate to the desired directory and run the main Python script. For instance, to play the Tetris game:

```
cd tetris_pygame
python main.py
```

For the video extractor:

```
cd video_extractor
python main.py
```
